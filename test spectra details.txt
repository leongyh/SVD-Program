The attached excel file is a matrix of spectra for testing the SVD program. 
It has the spectra or a monomer-dimer (M, D) mixture as a function of the 
nominal concentration (c in moles/L calcd using the MW of the monomer).  
The values shown are the experimental absorbances for a 1 cm path length. 
The object of the program is to determine the spectra of the monomer and the 
dimer. By fitting these spectra to the experiment ones we can deduce the 
concentrations of the M and D and thus the equilibrium constant  for dimerization:  
D = 2M, K(1,2) = D/M^2. The other attachment is a figure showing the expl spectra.
